By default, all users can see all application instances in the ClearML UI, but admins can change this policy per
application or per tenant.

## Default Visibility (All Applications) [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_visibility_policy/\#default-visibility-all-applications "Direct link to Default Visibility (All Applications)")

Set the default visibility for all application instances using the `applications.app_instance_access.allowed` field in
the `services.conf`, or the equivalent environment variable `CLEARML__services__applications__app_instance_access__allowed`.

The value options are:

- `all` \- All users can see application instances (default)
- `owner` \- Only the user who launched the application instance can see it
- `group` \- Allows the user launching the application instance to select whether to keep the instance private (visible
only to them) or allow specific user groups to see it as well: The launch form will include a **Shared Access**
toggle; when enabled, the user can choose the groups to share the instance with.

For example, to set the default visibility to group on Kubernetes, add the following to clearml-values.override.yaml:

```text
apiserver:

 extraEnvs:

   - name: CLEARML__services__applications__app_instance_access__allowed

     value: "group"
```

## Per-Application Overrides [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_visibility_policy/\#per-application-overrides "Direct link to Per-Application Overrides")

To override the default visibility behavior for a specific application, use:

```text
CLEARML__services__applications__app_instance_access__applications__<app_id>__allowed
```

Where `<app_id>` is the application ID.

Finding App ID

You can find an app ID in the following locations:

- In the application's `app.conf` file, under the `id` key.
- In the application's UI page:
1. Click `+` to open the application launch form
2. Hover over ![Info](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/icons/ico-info.svg) next to
     **Show Form Spec**. The application ID appears in the tooltip under `App Key`.

Supported values are the same as the global setting (`all`, `owner`, `group`).

Kubernetes example:

```text
apiserver:

  extraEnvs:

    - name: CLEARML__services__applications__app_instance_access__applications__hpo_app__allowed

      value: "owner"
```

## Multi-Tenant Configuration [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_visibility_policy/\#multi-tenant-configuration "Direct link to Multi-Tenant Configuration")

In multi-tenant environments, you can configure application instance visibility per tenant.

Use the [`system.update_company_app_instance_access`](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/references/enterprise/system#post-systemupdate_company_app_instance_access)
API endpoint and provide the tenant (company) ID along with the visibility configuration.

```text
curl $APISERVER_URL/system.update_company_app_instance_access \

 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

 -u $APISERVER_KEY:$APISERVER_SECRET \

 -d '{

   "company": "<company_id>",

   "app_instance_access": {

     "applications": {

       "<app_id>": {

         "allowed": "groups"

       }

     }

   }

 }'
```
