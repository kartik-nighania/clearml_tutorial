Enterprise Feature

Multi-node scheduling is only supported by a ClearML Enterprise Server.

The ClearML Agent supports running a single Task across multiple pods on different Kubernetes nodes.

This is useful for distributed training where the training job needs to span multiple GPUs and potentially multiple nodes.

## Prerequisites [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/multi_node_training/\#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Multi-node scheduling requires ClearML Enterprise Server and the following values set in the agent Helm overrides file:

```yaml
agentk8sglue:

  # Cluster access is required to run multi-node Tasks

  serviceAccountClusterAccess: true

  multiNode:

    enabled: true
```

## Per-task Multi-Node Configuration [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/multi_node_training/\#per-task-multi-node-configuration "Direct link to Per-task Multi-Node Configuration")

Tasks define their GPU and node requirements through the following [Task user properties](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/fundamentals/hyperparameters#user-properties):

| Property | Required | Allowed Values | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `multi_node_request` | ![Yes](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/icons/ico-optional-yes.svg) | JSON array of integers | GPU requirements (see layouts below) | — |
| `multi_node_request_layout` | ![No](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/icons/ico-optional-no.svg) | `gpus_per_node_count`, `gpus_per_node_list` | How to interpret `multi_node_request` | `gpus_per_node_count` |
| `multi_node_type` | ![No](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/icons/ico-optional-no.svg) | `physical`, `logical` | Node allocation strategy | `physical` |

- **`multi_node_request`** \- An array of integers that defines the GPU resources for the training job.Its values are
interpreted according to `multi_node_request_layout` below. This property is required for the task to make use of
multi-node scheduling.

- **`multi_node_request_layout`** \- Controls how `multi_node_request` is interpreted out of the following options:


  - `gpus_per_node_count` (default) - The array has exactly **two items**: `[gpus_per_node, number_of_nodes]`.
    For example, `multi_node_request = [2, 6]` means: 2 GPUs per node and 6 nodes, so 12 GPUs in total. Internally
    expanded to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.

  - `gpus_per_node_list` \- Each value in the array represents the number of GPUs assigned to a specific node.
    For example:





    ```text
    multi_node_request = [2, 2, 4]

    multi_node_request_layout = gpus_per_node_list
    ```









    This means:


    - 3 nodes in total
    - Node 0 gets 2 GPUs
    - Node 1 gets 2 GPUs
    - Node 2 gets 4 GPUs

In total, 8 GPUs.
To schedule the workload, ClearML splits GPU requests into pods, each assigned an equal number of GPUs. The number
of GPUs per pod is determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the requested GPU counts.

In this example, the GCD of `[2, 2, 4]` is 2, so every pod gets 2 GPUs.

    - Node 0 → 1 pod (2 GPUs),
    - Node 1 → 1 pod (2 GPUs)
    - Node 2 → 2 pods (2 GPUs each).

In total, 4 pods.

Use `gpus_per_node_list` when you need heterogeneous GPU allocation across nodes.

- **`multi_node_type`**\- Controls how workloads are placed on physical nodes:
  - `physical` (default) - Ensures workloads are distributed across distinct Kubernetes nodes. Use this when you want
    exclusive node access.
  - `logical` \- Allows multiple workloads to share the same physical node. Use this to maximize cluster utilization when
    workloads don't need exclusive node access.

### Task Configuration Example [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/multi_node_training/\#task-configuration-example "Direct link to Task Configuration Example")

![Multi-node scheduling example](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/assets/images/multi_node_scheduling-aa1ff0a548823c842374409f9a6a8729.png#light-mode-only)![Multi-node scheduling example](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/assets/images/multi_node_scheduling_dark-3ca76bd2c24ee08b864bb507c77ae789.png#dark-mode-only)

## Queue Level Multi-Node Configuration [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/multi_node_training/\#queue-level-multi-node-configuration "Direct link to Queue Level Multi-Node Configuration")

Instead of specifying GPU requirements in each specific Task, you can have the ClearML agent apply the resource
configuration based on the queue a task was serviced through so that all Tasks enqueued on that queue will use the same
multi-node configuration.

```yaml
agentk8sglue:

  serviceAccountClusterAccess: true

  multiNode:

    enabled: true

  createQueues: true

  queues:

    multi-node-queue:

      queueSettings:

        # Defines GPU needs per worker (e.g., 4 GPUs and 2 GPUs). Multiple Pods will be spawned respectively based on the greatest-common-divisor defined.

        multiNode: [4, 2]

      templateOverrides:

        resources:

          limits:

            # Note you will need to use the greatest-common-divisor of the GPUs distribution defined in `queueSettings.multiNode`.

            nvidia.com/gpu: 2
```

The `multiNode` list defines GPU requirements per node, similar to `gpus_per_node_list`. `multiNode: [4, 2]` means:

- Node 0 gets 4 GPUs
- Node 1 gets 2 GPUs

ClearML splits each node's GPU requirement into pods using the GCD of the list. The GCD of `[4, 2]` is 2, so every pod
gets 2 GPUs — enforced by `limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 2`.

- Node 0 → 2 pod (2 GPUs each),
- Node 1 → 1 pod (2 GPUs)

In total, 3 pods.

## Environment Variables [​](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/multi_node_training/\#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

Each pod created by multi-node scheduling has the following environment variables set,
compatible with standard distributed training frameworks (PyTorch DDP, DeepSpeed, etc.):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NODE_RANK` | Rank of this pod (0 = master) |
| `WORLD_SIZE` | Total number of GPUs across all pods |
| `MASTER_ADDR` | DNS address of the master pod (via headless Service) |
| `MASTER_PORT` | Communication port on the master pod (default: 29500) |
| `CLEARML_MULTI_NODE_SINGLE_TASK` | Set to `1` to indicate this pod is part of a multi-node Task |

See multi-node scheduling in action in the [finetune\_qa\_lora.py](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/blob/master/examples/hyperdatasets/finetune_qa_lora.py)
example script. This example demonstrates using multi-node distributed training to fine-tune a base LLM with LoRA adapters.
